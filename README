HTML-FromArrayref

The previously existing HTML generation modules, such as HTML:LoL, don't
make it easy to programmatically skip a tag or an attribute, so here's a
simple module that takes a list of arrayrefs and renders them as HTML
elements, replacing any whose tag names are false with their contents.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
